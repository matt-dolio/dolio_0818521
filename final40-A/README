****************************************
         SICK GAINS, The Code
****************************************

This assignment is in honor of one of my first students who 
was a weightlifter. He wrote something similar after taking
CSCI 40, so he could track his sick gains.

For this assignment, you will track how much you can lift
in the squat and the chest fly.

Basically, you will enter a series of numbers corresponding to 
how much weight you lift each week, ending with a 0. The 0 doesn't
get added to the vector.

The program will then calculate two numbers for each series:
1) How much you can lift now compared with the baseline
2) How much less you can lift now compared with your max lift

The baseline is hardcoded into the program, and is set at:
100 kilos for the squat
10 kilos for the chest fly

If the user ever enters a negative lift, the program should quit with:
Do you even lift, bro?

Correct behavior is as follows:

----------------------------------------

Example #1: The user is up 200 from baseline, but down 100 from the max
on squats, and is down from both the baseline and max on chest fly.

Please enter your squats (one per line, 0 to quit):
200
300
400
300
0
Your gains in squats: 200
Your losses in squats: -100
Please enter your chest fly (one per line, 0 to quit):
20
30
10
1
0
Your gains in chest fly: -9
Your losses in chest fly: -29

----------------------------------------

Example #2: Bad input

Please enter your squats (one per line, 0 to quit):
10
30000
-100
Do you even lift, bro?
