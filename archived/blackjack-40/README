For this assignment, you will be playing a variant of Blackjack where the
player tries to get as close to 40 as possible without going over. The player
starts with $100 and always $10 per hand. If they go over, they "go bust" and
pay $10 to the dealer.

Once they finish, the dealer will go, and will draw cards until they get a 36
or higher. If the dealer goes over 40, the dealer goes bust and pays $10 to
the player if they have not gone bust.

If the dealer doesn't go bust, then the dealer's score is compared with the
score of the player. If they player is higher than the dealer's, they gain
$10, they lose $10 if they have less, and no money is exchanged on a tie.

The value of a card is the face value (i.e. an 8 is worth 8 points, a
jack/queen/king is worth 10) except for aces, which count either as 11 or 1,
whichever is more advantageous for the player. I recommend when you start just
always treating it as an 11 and worrying about handling this after doing
everything else.

Playing a game of Blackjack-40:

1) The player is initially dealt four cards

2) If they are dealt a 40, they print "BLACKJACK 40!" and they win $20.

3) They can choose to hit or stay or quit. Hit means they are dealt another card.
If they hit and go over 40, they go bust and pay $10 to the dealer. If they
hit they can continue hitting until they bust or choose to stay or quit.
Stay means they keep their total and the dealer gets to go.
Quit means the game terminates.

4) After the player is done, deal cards for the dealer until they get a 35
or higher.

5) Handle the money payments as described above. If the player wins they gain
$10, if they lose they lose $10, if they tie no money is exchanged.

6) If the player hits $200 they win the game, if they hit $0 they lose the
game, and the game ends.

7) Otherwise, go back up to #1 and do it again
