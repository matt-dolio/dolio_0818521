Purpose: This program is designed to help users learn musical chords. As of
right now, it only supports recognizing three chords: C major (made of up "C"
"E" "G"), F major ("F" "A" "C") and G major ("G" "B" "D"). 

The user will type in three strings and if those strings appear in any order
(chord inversions if you are a music person) the program will output what
chord it is. If it's not one of the three chords we recognize so far, output
"Unknown".

Example 1: if they type in "C E G" it will print "C Major"
Example 2: if they type in "A C F" it will print "F Major"
Example 3: if they type in "G B D" it will print "G Major"
Example 4: if they type in "A B C" it will print "Unknown"

The code should also do some basic error checking. All notes must be "A"
through "G". If they type in a word other than "A" through "G" call the die()
function. If they type in less than three notes, also call die, which prints
"BAD INPUT!" and quits.

Example 5: if they type in "Foo Bar" it will print "BAD INPUT!"
Example 6: if they type in "C E H" it will print "BAD INPUT!"
