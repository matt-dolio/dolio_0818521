This program simulates a simple game called Yahtzee-3. The program will roll
three six-sided dice. If the three match, then it prints YAHTZEE and the user
wins 50 points. If they aren't all the same, then the user scores whatever the
total of the three dice are. The game ends once the user collects 100 points.

The user can choose a different random seed each time to get difference dice
rolls.
