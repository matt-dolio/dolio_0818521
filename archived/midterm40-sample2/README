=====================

For this assignment, you will debug the beginning of a roleplaying game (RPG).
So far, the code does the following:
1) It reads in a random seed, which is used to initialize the pseurandom
number generator in a deterministic fashion, so you get the same "random"
world each time you pick the same number.
2) It generates a random world, consisting of open tiles, walls, and
treasures. Constants at the top of main.cc control the relative percentages of
these tiles, and the size of the world.
3) It then asks the user where they want to start. If they pick a wall or
treasure tile, they die. Otherwise it says it is okay and starts the game
(which is yet to be written, and you don't need to write).
