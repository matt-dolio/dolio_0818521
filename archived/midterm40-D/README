=================================================================

This program prompts the user for a random seed. Random seeds are used to
initialize a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), so that you always get the same
numbers after you seed it. If you re-seed the PRNG, it will spit out the same
numbers as before.

After the user types in the seed, the program opens a file called file.txt,
and writes 10 random numbers to it. These numbers range from 0 to 9.

It then closes the file and opens it up again. It re-seeds the PRNG back to
the original seed the user typed in and reads the file and sees if what was
written to disk matches the same sequence.
