This assignment is quite simple. The program prompts the user for the radius
of a circle, and it outputs the area of the circle.

The equation for the area of a circle is pi*r^2.

It will check to see if the radius is less than or equal to 0, and if so print
out an error instead. It will also print out an error if they type in a
non-floating point number.

Example 1: Please enter the radius of a circle: 1 The area of a circle of that
radius is: 3.14159

Example 2: Please enter the radius of a circle: 0 You typed in a bad radius!

Example 3: Please enter the radius of a circle: 7.12 The area of a circle of
that radius is: 159.261

Example 4: Please enter the radius of a circle: a You typed in a bad radius!

Hint: M_PI is defined ccmath
