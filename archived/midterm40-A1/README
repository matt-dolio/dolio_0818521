This program is called "Fun" since computer science is fun.

Also because it's a function.

It is a very simple program. The user inputs x, and the code is supposed to
output the square root of the absolute value of x, times 1.5. I.e.: f(x) = 3*(sqrt(abs(x)) / 2)

It will print the returned value with 2 significant digits.

Sample runs:
Please enter a double:
9
f(x) = 4.50

Please enter a double:
25
f(x) = 7.50

Please enter a double:
1
f(x) = 1.50

Please enter a double:
2
f(x) = 2.12

Please enter a double:
3
f(x) = 2.60

Please enter a double:
5
f(x) = 3.35

Please enter a double:
0
f(x) = 0.00

Please enter a double:
-100
f(x) = 15.00
