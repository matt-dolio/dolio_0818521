In this game you will write a more generalized version of tic-tac-toe.

For an A you will need to:

1) Have a working 5x5 game of tic-tac-toe, in which two players take turns
entering Xs and Os.
2) Don't allow moves into spots that have been taken already.
3) You should be able to change a single number in your code and make the
board larger or smaller. I.e. NO MAGIC NUMBERS.
4) Will detect a winning board position (5 in a row all of one symbol)
5) Will detect when there is a draw (board full).

Each point you miss above is -1 to your grade.

Writing an AI is worth +1 point
6) You can have an AI play with you instead if you have no friends.
7) Make printing the board prettier with rows and column numbers
