You know what time it is? Everyone's favorite time! Algebra Time!

For this assignment, you have a program that is going to test to see if two
line segments intersect each other. I copied and pasted some code from Stack
Overflow that seems to work.

Basically, for this assignment, the user will type in two line segments, and
the program returns true or false based on if the lines intersect or not. I
added a cool graphing component that will help you visualize it, too.

==========================================

Sample Run #1 - Non intersecting lines:

Reading in the first line. (0,0) is the top left of the screen, (9,9) the bottom right.
Please enter x_min for the first line:
3
Please enter x_max for the first line:
6
Please enter y_min for the first line:
0
Please enter y_max for the first line:
3
Please enter x_min for the second line:
0
Please enter x_max for the second line:
3
Please enter y_min for the second line:
5
Please enter y_max for the second line:
Do the lines intersect? Survey says: false
